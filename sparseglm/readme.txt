This is an advance copy of the software associated with the article "Estimating classication images with Laplacian priors in Generalized Linear Models" By Mineault, Barthelmé & Pack. The main algorithm presented in the appendix of the article is implemented in the files glmfitsparseprior.m and vglmfitsparseprior.m.  glmfitquadprior and cvglmfitquadprior are also included to fit models with Gaussian priors, although these aren't fast or clever implementations compared to the sparse prior implementation. The examples folder includes files that duplicate 4 of the figures in the article.

The file Figure5.m requires the Steerable Pyramid toolbox to be installed (http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/steerpyr/). Although I have tried to avoid needless dependencies, other toolboxes may be required. If you do not have a required toolbox, please contact me so I can implement a workaround.

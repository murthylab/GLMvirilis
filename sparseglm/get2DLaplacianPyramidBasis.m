    %function [B] = get2DLaplacianPyramidBasis(width, height, levels, step,
    %FWHM)
    %
    %Get a 2d Laplacian pyramid basis matrix of given number of levels for 
    %images of size width x height. step indicates the spacing of levels (1
    %= regular Laplacian pyramid, 0.5 = Laplacian pyramid with
    %half-levels). FWHM is full width at half-max for the Gaussians at
    %level 1 (the finest level). 
    %
    %Differences from "standard LP implementation": this implementation is
    %designed to be more flexible such that the chosen basis functions can
    %be more tightly spaced or less decimated than usual. Level 1 is not
    %treated as a "residual" or "pixel" level: it uses Gaussians of the
    %specified FWHM. Gaussians center locations differ from the standard
    %implementation for levels 3 and up: they are set up such that they
    %avoid edges (for example, for a 17x17 image, the level three leftmost 
    %and topmost basis function is centered at (3,3), not (1,1). Basis
    %functions which touch edges are not distorted, simply cropped.
